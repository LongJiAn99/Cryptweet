# Cryptweet

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Inspiration
Having witnessed first hand how my friends and family are being victims by the ruthless and volatile Cryptocurrency market, we felt the need to bring forth an application which could perhaps help gain some valuable insights that might play a part. With that in mind, we have aspired to be a beacon of stability amidst this dangerous market. We believe in the fact that other's feelings and thoughts can affect Cryptocurrency prices greatly (e.g. Elon Musk tweeting "im selling btc"), hence the power of Sentiment Analysis. 

## What it does
There are many Cryptocurrency aggregator dashboards in the internet, but what makes Cryptweet stand out would be the fact that besides basic information like price, market cap, and change, we have also included the number of tweets and verified tweets. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platform where most of the Cryptocurrency discussions are held. We make use of the Twitter API to retrieve the number of tweets that mentions the particular coin/token while taking inspiration from Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and fundamentals. Other metrics are retrieved from the CoinGecko API, which is a reliable site. There are also additional features such as viewing the top tweets of the day, and charts that accurately reflect the tweets over a period of time. After all, it is not only a dashboard, but an experience in itself.

## How we built it
Despite being proficient in React, we are reminded of the objective of this Hackathon, which was to step out of our comfort zones and be proactive in learning. During the past few days, we made up our minds together and went to learn another framework which excites us, **Angular.**
Over the course of the Hackathon, we surpassed our expectations and managed to built something that we are proud of. We faced certain troubles (which will be mentioned in the next section), but have achieved milestones we have set for ourselves. Working together and retrieving crucial data using API calls that were mystifying to us made our project all the better. After all, it wasn't built all with tech, but also the passion we have!  

## Challenges we ran into
To our dismay, we found it slightly difficult to use the Twitter API, as we attempted to fetch data from Twitter using version 2 of API. Together with using the Angular Framework and limited resources pertaining to our obstacles, we had to spend **COUNTLESS** hours on stackoverflow, reading documentations and watching youtube tutorials. It was a tiring ordeal, but we managed to pull through (with only minimal sleep).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our final product, although not fully completed. The fantastic UI/UX design, Minimalistic yet Futuristic, is one that we think we should give ourselves a pat on the back. We are not well versed in every aspect of software engineering, BUT we have exceeded our expectations and made leaps and bounds in our tech journey. We stuck by our objectives and had not once thought of giving up.

## What we learned
We are humbled with the opportunity to take be a part of one of the craziest hackathons of our lives. It was well-planned, had an outstanding community, and brilliant incentives. Apart from the technical skills, we learnt that we should not give up, always be ambitious, step outside our comfort zone, and CRUSH our goals! 

## What's next for Cryptweet
We have an extensive roadmap ahead for Cryptweet. We plan on improving the user experience of conducting Sentiment Analysis by further enhancing the accuracy of tweets/verified tweets data. For instance, we can employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and fundamentals to derive statistics that will be greatly helpful. Apart from that, other minor features like user accounts and connecting with other cryptocurrency metrics would be effective in helping our cause. Thank you for your continuous support! ÔÅä 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
